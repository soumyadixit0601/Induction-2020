Here is a brief of all those things that are to be done within the span of a month. It is a well planned  path for all the newbies out there to groom up their coding skills.
The whole process is to be continued for a month starting from 18th of May and it will be conducted in four parts.<br>
<br>
The first part which is to be covered in the first week comprises of learning the basics of Github and a rigorous learning of competitive coding. You will be provided with all sorts of materials which will be an apt way to learn from.<br>
<br>

Second week starts with the learning of using a version control system, Git.
After that, you will be learning the basics of web development, the languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript and others to come on the way.<br>
<br>
 
Third week starts with a very popular language, Python. You will be learning the basic syntax and functioning of it and then we'll be heading towards the basics of Machine Learning.<br> 
<br>
The fourth and the final week will be all about learning app development. You will be getting an overview of all types of apps, be it native or hybrid, and their respective platforms to be implemented on.<br>
<br>
Don't these sound very interesting?
Come and explore!<br>
