Hello everyone.
This is Gourav Das. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology degree in Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology in the department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering.
I belong from Jagatsinghpur.
I am very much fond of coding and I believe that everything in this world can be coded and developed for desirable result.

Git is a platform where various coders and developers edit changes into existing software for a better tomorrow and one can also track down the changes made to it.

Thanks!
