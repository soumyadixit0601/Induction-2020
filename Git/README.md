# What to do? Where to go now?

Well, It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.<br>

No great sailor is born out of a silent sea, and we at Enigma, dont believe in spoon-feeding either.<br>
